# Hi everyone 😃👋
I'm Andrea Puricelli, a Statistical Learning and Engineering Graduate at Politecnico di Milano. My studies are focused on Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Data Science since my Bachelor's Degree. I am currently working on my Master's Thesis about Geostatistics and Spatial Extremes. 

## 🎓 Education:
- Bachelor / Master of Science in  Mathematical Engineering - Statistical Learning at Politecnico di Milano
## 📌 Projects:
- Nonparametric analysis of US dairy production and consumption: This project presents a nonparametric analysis of the US dairy market dynamics, spanning from 1985 to 2021, utilizing a range of statistical methods including GAMs, bootstrap, conformal prediction, spatial analysis, and Bayesian clustering to uncover insights into optimal operating areas, pricing strategies, and trending products.
- Stochastic Block Model Prior with Ordering Constraints for Gaussian Graphical Models: Constructed a Gibbs Sampler from scratch and introduced a new Bayesian prior within the framework of Gaussian Graphical Models enabling the learning of conditional dependence block structure among variables, while accommodating ordering constraints.
- Development of a wearable fall detection system using Machine Learning: Created a Python-based classification system that utilizes accelerometer data to differentiate various activities of daily living, including running, walking, and falling. This system leverages machine learning models and employs time series feature extraction techniques for accurate activity recognition.
